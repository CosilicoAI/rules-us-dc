Each notice shall be sufficiently accurate and detailed for the rate payer to understand the filing, including the rate payer’s specified affected interest. The notice shall provide the specific rate or service change affecting the rate payer, including the proposed percentage and dollar increase for the rate and rider category of the customer. For every proceeding in which the Commission has a public hearing, the public shall be given a timely opportunity to present its views, as evidence of record, with at least 45 days notice, with notice widely and publicly distributed in a form sufficiently detailed and complete to permit the public to realize its specific and affected interest.</akn:p></akn:content>
