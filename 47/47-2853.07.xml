The members first appointed shall serve staggered terms made for one, 2, or 3 years so that approximately one-third of the membership of each board shall expire each year. Members of the boards shall serve until their successor is appointed. Members may be appointed to succeed themselves, provided, however, that no member shall be appointed to serve more than 3 full consecutive 3-year terms. The terms of members of a board, after the initial terms, shall expire on the third anniversary of the date the first members constituting a quorum take the oath of office. A vacancy on a board shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment was made. A member appointed to fill a vacancy shall serve until the expiration of the term or until a successor is appointed and sworn into office, whichever is later.</akn:p></akn:content>
