The Master Developer and any subsequent owner of a lot shall provide notice to the buyer of the lot of the levy of the Special Assessment and any contract for the sale of the lot may be voided without penalty by the buyer prior to purchase of the lot if the buyer does not receive notice of the Special Assessment from the Master Developer or the subsequent owner.</akn:p></akn:content>

      <akn:content><akn:p>The owner of a lot subject to Special Assessment under this subchapter may contest the amount of the Special Assessment, but not the authority to levy the Special Assessment, by filing a written notice of appeal of the amount with the Chief Financial Officer not later than 180 days after the due date of the payment of the Special Assessment. The Chief Financial Officer, or the administrator if designated by the Chief Financial Officer to hear the appeal, shall promptly review the appeal and, if necessary, meet with the owner of the lot, consider written and oral evidence regarding the amount of the Special Assessment, and decide the appeal. If the result of the appeal requires the Special Assessment to be modified or changed in favor of the owner of the lot, a cash refund shall not be made (except in the last year of the levy), but an adjustment shall be made to the next Special Assessment to be collected from that lot. No interest on the adjustment shall be due to the owner of the lot. A decision of the administrator may be appealed to the Chief Financial Officer. This procedure shall be exclusive and its exhaustion by any owner of a lot shall be a condition precedent to any other appeal or legal action by the owner.</akn:p></akn:content>
