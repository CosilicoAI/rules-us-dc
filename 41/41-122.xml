      <akn:content><akn:p>Unless the Mayor considers it to be in the best interest of the District to do otherwise, all securities abandoned under § 41-109 must be held for at least 3 years before the Mayor may sell them. If the Mayor sells any securities delivered pursuant to § 41-109 before the expiration of the 3-year period, any person making a claim pursuant to this chapter before the end of 3 years is entitled to either the proceeds of the sale of the securities or the market value of the securities at the time the claim is made, whichever is greater, less any deduction for fees pursuant to § 41-123(c). A person making a claim under this chapter after the expiration of this period is entitled to receive either the securities delivered to the Mayor by the holder, if they still remain in the hands of the Mayor, or the proceeds received from the sale, less any amounts deducted pursuant to § 41-123(c); but no person has any claim under this chapter against the District, the holder, any transfer agent, registrar, or other person acting for or on behalf of a holder for any appreciation in the value of the property occurring after delivery by the holder to the Mayor.</akn:p></akn:content>
