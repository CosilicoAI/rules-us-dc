Whenever wages, salaries, annuities, retirement and disability benefits, or other remuneration based upon employment is sought to be levied pursuant to this section, the legal process shall be such as is usual in other cases of attachment, garnishment, assignment, or withholding under the District of Columbia Child Support Enforcement Amendment Act of 1985. The government of the District of Columbia shall be subject to process in the same manner and to the same extent as if it were a private person, except that no writ or similar process served under the authority of this section shall be honored by the government of the District of Columbia unless a certified copy of the judgment, order, or decree upon which the levy is predicated has been provided to the Mayor of the District of Columbia or his duly authorized designee.</akn:p></akn:content>
