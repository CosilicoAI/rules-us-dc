The Court shall make a determination of each appeal on the basis of the record established before the hearing examiner, and may affirm, reverse, or modify the order of the hearing examiner, or may remand the case for further proceedings before the hearing examiner subject to the qualifications set forth in this subsection. The Court shall set aside any hearing examiner order that is unsupported by a preponderance of the evidence on the record.
