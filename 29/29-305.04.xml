If not otherwise fixed under § 29-305.07 and if prior board action is required with respect to the action to be taken without a meeting, the record date shall be the close of business on the day the resolution of the board taking such prior action is adopted. No consent in a record is effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest date on which a consent delivered to the corporation as required by this section was signed, consents in a record signed by sufficient shareholders to take the action have been delivered to the corporation. A consent in a record may be revoked by a record to that effect delivered to the corporation before unrevoked consents in a record sufficient in number to take the corporate action are delivered to the corporation.</akn:p></akn:content>
