The bylaws of an association that provides multi-family cooperative housing for low and moderate income individuals who are receiving assistance through one or more of the federal programs described in § 47-1002(20) may provide that one or more of the directors, but not a majority of the directors, may be appointed by a nonprofit sponsoring organization which helped create the association so as to maintain a continuing and stabilizing interest in its well-being; provided, that the sponsoring organization shall not appoint any directors after the association has been established for 10 years. The director or directors appointed by the sponsoring organization need not be members of the association. Vacancies in the board of directors, otherwise than by removal or expiration of term, shall be filled in such manner as the bylaws may provide.</akn:p></akn:content>
