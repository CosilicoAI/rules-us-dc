      <akn:content><akn:p>If requested by the Department, either on its own behalf or on behalf of another public or private agency designated by the Mayor, the Attorney General shall promptly conduct a factual inquiry and, if legally supportable, file a petition in court for a provisional protection order. That petition shall state, insofar as the facts can be ascertained with reasonable diligence:</akn:p></akn:content>

      <akn:content><akn:p>Unless continued by the court, a nonjury hearing shall be held on a petition for a provisional protection order within 15 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after it is filed with the court. The Attorney General shall ensure that, at least 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) before the hearing, notice of the hearing date and a copy of the petition are served on the adult in need of protective services and, if applicable and ascertainable with reasonable diligence, the person(s) allegedly responsible for the abuse, neglect, or exploitation, for using fear or intimidation to coerce the adult’s objection to the provision of services, or for denying an APS worker reasonable access to the adult. Notice shall be effected by personal service, substitute service on a person of suitable age and discretion at the usual place of abode or employment of the person to be notified, or registered or certified mail. Pursuant to rules to be established by the court, subpoenas shall issue directing the appearance of persons whose presence at the hearing is essential to the relief sought in the petition. The adult in need of protective services and any other person on whom notice is served under this subsection shall have the right to retain counsel, and if indigent, to have counsel promptly appointed by the court upon the Attorney General’s filing of a petition under subsection (a) of this section. Every effort shall be made to secure the presence of the adult in need of protective services at the hearing; failure of the adult to appear shall be explained by his or her counsel to the satisfaction of the court. All parties to the proceeding may present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Testimony of the person(s) allegedly responsible for the abuse, neglect, or exploitation, and the fruits of that testimony, shall be inadmissible as evidence in a subsequent criminal trial except in a prosecution for perjury or false statement.</akn:p></akn:content>

      <akn:content><akn:p>The court shall maintain a register of lawyers who have expressed an interest in representing indigent persons entitled to the appointment of counsel under subsection (b) of this section, and shall attempt insofar as possible to make appointments from this register. Publicly funded or pro bono legal services shall be considered and given priority by the court. If such services are unavailable, compensation for appointed counsel shall be at the hourly rate established pursuant to § 11-2604(a), and, unless expressly waived by the court, shall be subject to a maximum amount of $750 per proceeding. Counsel shall also be reimbursed for expenses reasonably incurred. Compensation for investigative, expert, and other services shall be in accordance with § 11-2605. This subsection shall be implemented pursuant to procedures established by the court.</akn:p></akn:content>

Secondarily, the court shall inquire about and take into consideration potential expense to the District.</akn:p></akn:content>

      <akn:content><akn:p>The court may modify or rescind a provisional protection order upon the motion of any party to the original proceeding and for good cause shown. Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, a provisional protection order granting the relief in subsection (d)(4) or (5) of this section shall remain effective as to that relief for such period up to 45 calendar days as the court may specify, except that on the motion of any party to the original proceeding and for good cause shown, the court may grant a single extension for a period not to exceed an additional 45 calendar days. This 90-day time limitation may not be circumvented by the attempted issuance of a new order or reissuance of the original order before or after the extension period has expired. Relief granted under subsection (d)(1) through (3) and (6) of this section shall remain effective for such period as the court may specify.</akn:p></akn:content>
