If the applicant is making good faith efforts to meet the schedule, the SHPDA shall extend the certificate of need for an additional period or periods as necessary for the applicant to complete the project. The SHPDA shall adopt rules to define the schedule of performance, including reporting, criteria for evaluating compliance or noncompliance with the schedule, and criteria for determining and reviewing major modifications after a certificate of need has been issued. Any review of major modifications shall be limited to the modifications and shall not affect the underlying certificate of need granted by the SHPDA.</akn:p></akn:content>
