If the amount set forth in the fleet infraction report is not paid within 30 days, the Director shall notify the owner in writing that failure to pay within 30 days of the date of the notice of failure to pay shall be grounds for removal from the program. A fleet owner shall be given notice in writing if it is being removed from the program. The effective date of the removal shall be the date that notice of removal is sent to the fleet owner. A fleet owner shall not be entitled to adjudicate any violations listed in the monthly fleet infraction report. Penalties set forth in § 50-2301.05(a)(2) are not applicable to the fleet reconciliation program. If a fleet owner is removed from the program by the Director, then the penalties set forth in § 50-2301.05(a)(2) shall immediately apply and the owner shall be responsible for any penalties that would have incurred if the vehicle had not been part of the program. A fleet vehicle shall not be subject to towing or immobilization, for failure to pay notices of infraction while part of the fleet reconciliation program. If a fleet vehicle is removed from the program, either voluntarily or as a result of removal by the Director, the vehicle shall become immediately subject to towing or immobilization if the vehicle would have been subject to towing or immobilization had it not been part of the program.</akn:p></akn:content>
