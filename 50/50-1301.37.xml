If such person be not a resident of the District of Columbia, the privilege of operating any motor vehicle in the District of Columbia and the privilege of operation within the District of Columbia of any motor vehicle owned by him shall be suspended until he shall have furnished proof of financial responsibility for the future with respect to all such vehicles registered by such person as the owner, and such person shall not be allowed a license, nor shall such owner be allowed to register any vehicle in the District of Columbia, until he has complied with the requirements of this subchapter to the same extent that would be necessary if, at the time of the conviction or forfeiture, he had held a license or had been the owner of a vehicle registered in the District of Columbia.</akn:p></akn:content>
