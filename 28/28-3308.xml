      <akn:content><akn:p>On a loan (other than a loan directly secured on real estate or a direct motor vehicle installment loan covered by Chapter 36 of this subtitle) to be repaid in equal or substantially equal monthly or other periodic installments, including a loan obtained by using a check, credit card, or other device to access a line of credit, any federally insured bank or savings and loan association doing business in the District of Columbia may contract for and receive interest at the rate permitted under this chapter or, in lieu of such interest, a finance charge, which if expressed as an annual percentage rate, does not exceed a rate of 24% per annum on the unpaid balances of the principal. This section does not limit or restrict the manner of contracting for the finance charge, whether by way of discount, add-on, or simple interest, so long as the annual percentage rate of the finance charge does not exceed that permitted by this section.</akn:p></akn:content>

The minimum charge may not exceed the smaller of the following: (1) the amount of the finance charge contracted for, or (2) $5 in a transaction which had a principal of $75 or less, or $7.50 in a transaction which had a principal of more than $75.</akn:p></akn:content>
