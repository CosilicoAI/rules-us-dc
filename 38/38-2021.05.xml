      <akn:content><akn:p>Except as otherwise provided in this part, every teacher who shall be retired under the provisions of § 38-2021.03 or § 38-2021.04 shall receive an annuity composed of: (1) the larger of: (A) one and one-half per centum of the average salary as defined in § 38-2021.13, multiplied by so much of the total service as does not exceed 5 years; or (B) one per centum of the average salary, plus $25, multiplied by so much of the total service as does not exceed 5 years; plus (2) the larger of: (A) one and three-quarters per centum of the average salary multiplied by so much of the total service as exceeds 5 years but does not exceed 10 years; or (B) one per centum of the average salary, plus $25, multiplied by so much of the total service as exceeds 5 years but does not exceed 10 years; plus (3) the larger of: (A) two per centum of the average salary multiplied by so much of the total service as exceeds 10 years; or (B) one per centum of the average salary, plus $25, multiplied by so much of the total service as exceeds 10 years. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, every teacher retired under the provisions of § 38-2021.03 or § 38-2021.05 who is hired on or after the first day of the first pay period that begins after October 29, 1996 shall receive an annuity equal to 2% of the average salary as defined in § 38-2021.13 multiplied by the number of years of the teacher’s creditable service. Each annuity is stated as an annual amount, one twelfth of which, fixed at the nearest dollar, constitutes the monthly rate payable on the first business day of the month after the month or other period for which it has accrued. Annuities payable to any retired teacher who has become eligible for retirement because of age as defined in § 38-2021.03 shall be payable during the lifetime of the annuitant. Annuities payable to any teacher retired on account of disability shall be subject to the conditions set forth under § 38-2021.04.</akn:p></akn:content>
