      <akn:content><akn:p>Within 10 days of its date of registration, and 90 days in advance of the beginning of each fiscal year, each BID shall provide the CFO with a preliminary BID tax roll, which shall include, for each property subject to the relevant BID tax, the square number, the lot number, the name of the BID, the period of time for the BID tax, and the amount of the BID tax for that property for that period of time. In addition to the preliminary tax roll, the BID shall also provide supporting information which describes the information relied upon by the BID in preparing the preliminary tax roll. The supporting information shall be based on information provided to the BID by the Office of Taxation and Revenue and any other reliable source. The preliminary BID tax roll and the supporting information shall be prepared in such form as may be prescribed by regulation by the CFO. In the event that a BID fails to provide the preliminary BID tax roll and the supporting information within the time period specified by this subsection, the BID taxes shall be collected at the time of the next regularly scheduled tax bill.</akn:p></akn:content>
