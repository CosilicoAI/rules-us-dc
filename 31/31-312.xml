      <akn:content><akn:p>Upon written application of any insurer, the Mayor may grant an exemption from compliance with this chapter if the Mayor finds, upon review of the application, that compliance with this chapter would constitute a financial or organizational hardship upon the insurer and the public interest would not be unduly compromised by the exemption. An exemption may be granted at any time, and from time to time for a specified period or periods. Within 10 days from a denial of an insurer’s written request for an exemption from this chapter, the insurer may request in writing a hearing on its application for an exemption. The hearing shall be held in accordance with those rules pertaining to administrative hearing procedures as the Mayor may prescribe.</akn:p></akn:content>
