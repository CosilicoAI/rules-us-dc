In determining whether to disapprove any such form the Commissioner may give due consideration to past and prospective loss experience within and outside the District, to underwriting practice and judgment to the extent appropriate, and to all other relevant factors within and outside the District, and he may take into account the experience of the individual company.</akn:p></akn:content>
