      <akn:content><akn:p>A domestic corporation may borrow or assume a liability for the repayment of a sum of money under a written agreement which provides that the loan or advance shall be repaid only out of surplus of the corporation in excess of such minimum surplus as is stipulated in and by the agreement and if the surplus of the corporation after such payment would meet or exceed the level of surplus the corporation is required to maintain by the Mayor under the laws or regulations of the District of Columbia. The rate of interest specified in such an agreement may be adjusted no more frequently than annually to provide for a rate not exceeding the one-year treasury bill rate plus 3% at the time of adjustment. At the time the loan or advance is made, the interest rate shall not exceed the one-year treasury bill rate plus 3% annum.</akn:p></akn:content>
