In the case of domestic companies, such deposit shall be made in the District as prescribed under § 31-4316; provided, that the deposit of every domestic company heretofore organized under the provisions of the laws of the District or other act of Congress may, in the discretion of the Commissioner, be limited: (1) For stock companies, to an amount equal to the capital stock outstanding on June 19, 1934; and (2) for nonstock companies, to such amount as in the opinion of the Commissioner would be required from stock companies of comparable size. In no case shall the deposit of a domestic company be less than $25,000 in value. In the case of foreign or alien companies, the deposit may be made as provided under § 31-4316, or may be made with the supervising official of any state, territory, or insular possession of the United States authorized to accept such deposit, which shall be held for the benefit of all policyholders.</akn:p></akn:content>
